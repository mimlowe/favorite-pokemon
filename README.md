# EarnUp Take Home Test

## Instructions
For our take home test we want you to create a NextJS application that serves a PWA with three steps:

1. A form (using react-hook-form) that asks people for their name and email

2. A second form that asks them for their favorite pokemon.

3. Display the image and name of their favorite pokemon.


### Data
To get the list of pokemon (and their images) please use the pokemon api (https://pokeapi.co/) from the NextJS app and populate a drop down with the list of pokemon.


### Requirements:

1. Please use MaterialUI for styling.
2. Have the form be 
   1. Submittable, store the data however you would like
   2. Display the picture of the selected pokemon after the second form is submitted.
   3. On page reload, the page should remember which pokemon they selected.
3. The UI should be, at least minimally, responsive.

Please host your code on github or another git service with instructions for running your app.

# Running the Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
